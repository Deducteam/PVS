This is the root of the PVS 2.3 system.  It is under CVS control; the main
repository is in /project/pvs2/cvsroot/pvs2.3 (on the machine fluid).
To access this repository you must have the environment variable
CVSROOT set to /project/pvs2/cvsroot.  It may also help to have CVSREAD
set to true; this makes CVS behave more like RCS when in Emacs.
Note: all directories have CVS subdirectories that should not be directly
modified.

The following files and directories make up pvs2.3:
 Files:
  README           - this file
  pvs              - the shell script for invoking pvs
  
  pvs.system	   - used with src/defsystem.lisp to define the pvs system
		     this shows what files are actually needed to load up
		     a new system.  You can start up lisp and run
		     (load "pvs.system") (operate-on-system 'pvs :lf)
		     to do some debugging if make-pvs doesn't work.
  make-pvs	   - a shell script for making the pvs lisp image
  
  patch2.lisp      - released patches (may not exist)
  patch2-test.lisp - test patches (may not exist)
  patch2-exp.lisp  - experimental patches (may not exist)
  
  pvs-tex.sub      - the default substitution file for generating LaTeX
  pvs.sty	   - the style file supporting LaTeX output

 Directories:
  src   - the main lisp directory
  emacs - the directory for Emacs source files.
  wish  - the directory for Tcl/Tk files
  BDD   - the bdd package; part lisp and part C
  bin   - the directory for most of the shell scripts and executables
  ess   - the directory for the Ergo parser generator system
