<h1>PVS GUI</h1>
<p>
  This is an alpha version of a GUI for the PVS verification system.

<h3>Running the GUI</h3>
<p> The GUI communicates with PVS via XML-RPC. The GUI and PVS can be
  launched in any order. By default, the GUI assumes that PVS is running on
  localhost:22334. Start PVS with the -port flag, e.g.,
</p>
<p>
  <code> &nbsp; pvs -port 22334</code>
</p>
<p>and the GUI with</p><p>
  <code> &nbsp; pvs-gui</code></p>
<p>For more information on how to run the GUI, try "<code>pvs-gui --help</code>".</p>
<h3>GUI Overview</h3>
<p>The GUI has a very flexible and configurable design. Different parts of
  the GUI can be detached from the main frame and become a floating box, or
  be re-attached back to different parts of the frame based on user's
  preference. Similarly, each open PVS file can be dragged out of the
  frame and be placed back by closing the floating box.
</p>
<h3>Entering Lisp commands</h3>
<div>When the GUI is up and running, you can enter any lisp command
  (e.g. typecheck, change-context) using the console that appears at the
  bottom of the GUI by default.  (This is primarily for debugging; you need
  to consult the Common Lisp manual and PVS sources to know what functions
  are available.)
</div>
<h3>Menus</h3>
<div>The GUI provides a main menu with a number of options to communicate
  with PVS (e.g. changing the context). Furthermore, you can right-click on
  the open files and contexts to view a context menu with proper
  options. For instance, you can change the context by righ-clicking on any
  context/directory on the file tree and choose "Make Active Context". You
  can also typecheck a file in the active context by right-clicking on the
  file name and choosing "Typecheck".
</div>
<h3>Typechecking</h3>
<p>You can typecheck a file in the active context simply by right-clicking
  on its name and choosing the typecheck option. You will see an error
  message, along with a red mark if the typecheck fails. Otherwise, you may
  see a list of theories and formulas as a subtree under the file
  name. Furthermore, you will be able to hover the mouse pointer over
  different words in the PVS file to see the declarations as a tooltip. You
  could also right-click on the words and choose "Show Declaration" to see
  the original declaration.
</p>
<h3>Proof Manager</h3>
<p>The GUI hides and shows the different boxes according to the PVS
  mode. Once a formula is selected to be proved, the GUI enters the proof
  mode with the Proof Manager appearing on the right side. You will be able
  to enter different proof commands using the Proof Manager.
</p><p>
  Note that the GUI does not yet support showing proof scripts, with the
  possibility rerun or step through the proofs, so the GUI is not really
  ready to support serious proof development.  This should be available in
  the near future.
