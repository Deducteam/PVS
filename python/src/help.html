<h3>Running the GUI</h3>
<p>The GUI communicates with a running instance of PVS via xmlrpc.
	The GUI and PVS can be launched in any order. By default, the GUI
	assumes that PVS is running on localhost:22334. This is an example of
	how to start PVS and the GUI:</p>
<p>
	<em>PVS_HOME&gt; pvs -port 22334</em>
</p>
<p>
	<em>PVS_HOME&gt; ./pvs-gui</em>
</p>
<p>
	For more information on how to run the GUI, try "<em>./pvs-gui
		--help</em>".
</p>
<h3>Entering Lisp commands</h3>
<div>When the GUI is up and running, you can enter any lisp
	command (e.g. typecheck, change-context) using the console that appears
	at the bottom of the GUI by default.</div>
<h3>Menus</h3>
<div>The GUI provides a main menu with a number of options to
	communicate with PVS (e.g. changing the context). Furthermore, you can
	right-click on the open files and contexts to view a context menu with
	proper options. For instance, you can change the context by
	righ-clicking on any context/directory on the file tree and choose
	"Make Active Context". You can also typecheck a file in the active
	context by right-clicking on the file name and choosing "Typecheck".</div>
<h3>Proof Manager</h3>
<p>The GUI hides and shows the differnt boxes according to the PVS
	mode. Once a formula is selected to be proved, the GUI enters the proof
	mode with the Proof Manager appearing on the right side. You will be
	able to enter different proof commands using the Proof Manager.</p>
