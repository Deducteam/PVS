\section{Judgements}
\label{judgements}\index{judgements|(}

The facility for defining predicate subtypes is one of the most useful
features provided by PVS, but it can lead to a lot of redundant TCCs.
\emph{Judgements}\footnote{We prefer this spelling, though many spell
checkers do not.} provide a means for controlling this by allowing
properties of operators on subtypes to be made available to the
typechecker.  There are two kinds of judgements available in PVS\@.  The
\emph{constant judgement}\index{constant judgement} states that a
particular constant (or number) has a type more specific than its declared
type.  The \emph{subtype judgement}\index{subtype judgement} states that
one type is a subtype of another.

\subsection{Constant Judgements}
\index{constant judgement}

There are two kinds of constant judgements.  The simpler kind 
states that a constant or number belongs to a type different than its
declared type.\footnote{Remember that all numbers are implicitly declared to
be of type \texttt{real}.}  For example, the constant judgement
declaration
\begin{pvsex}
  JUDGEMENT c, 17 HAS_TYPE (prime?)
\end{pvsex}
simply states that the constant \texttt{c} and the number \texttt{17} are
both prime numbers.  This declaration leads to the TCC formulas
\texttt{prime?(c)} and \texttt{prime?(17)}, but in any context in which
this declaration is visible, the use of \texttt{c} or \texttt{17} where a
prime is expected will not generate TCCs.  Thus no TCCs are generated for
the formula \texttt{F} in
\begin{pvsex}
  RP: [(prime?), (prime?) -> bool]
  F: FORMULA RP(c, 17) IMPLIES RP(17, c)
\end{pvsex}

The second kind of constant judgement is for functions; argument types are
provided and the judgement states that when the function is applied to
arguments of the given types, then the result has the type following the
\texttt{HAS\_TYPE} keyword.  Here is an example that illustrates the need
for this kind of judgement:
\begin{pvsex}
  x, y: VAR real
  f(x,y): real = x*x - y*y
  n: int = IF f(1,2) > 0 THEN f(4,3) ELSE f(3,2) ENDIF
\end{pvsex}
This leads to two TCCs:
\begin{pvsex}
  n_TCC1: OBLIGATION
    f(1, 2) > 0 IMPLIES
      rational_pred(f(4, 3)) AND integer_pred(f(4, 3))
  n_TCC2: OBLIGATION
    NOT f(1, 2) > 0 IMPLIES
      rational_pred(f(3, 2)) AND integer_pred(f(3, 2))
\end{pvsex}
The problem here is that although we know that \texttt{f} is closed under
the integers, the typechecker does not.  If \texttt{f} is heavily used,
dealing with these TCCs becomes cumbersome.  We can try the \emph{ad hoc}
solution of adding new overloaded declarations for \texttt{f}:
\begin{pvsex}
  i, j: VAR nat
  f(i, j): int = f(i, j)
\end{pvsex}
But now proofs require an extra definition expansion, and such overloading
leads to confusion.\footnote{This is one of the motivations for providing
the \texttt{M-x~show-expanded-sequent} command.}  A more elegant solution
is to use a judgement declaration:
\begin{pvsex}
  f_int_is_int: JUDGEMENT f(i, j: int) HAS\_TYPE int
\end{pvsex}
This generates the TCC
\begin{pvsex}
  f_int_is_int: FORALL (x:int, y:int):
                  rational_pred(f(x, y)) AND integer_pred(f(x, y))
\end{pvsex}
But now the declaration of \texttt{n} given above generates \emph{no}
TCCs, as the typechecker ``knows'' that \texttt{f} is closed on the
integers.  Note that this is different than the simple judgement
\begin{pvsex}
  f_int: JUDGEMENT f HAS\_TYPE [int, int -> int]
\end{pvsex}
In this case, the TCC generated is unprovable:
\begin{pvsex}
  f_int: OBLIGATION
    ((FORALL (x: real): rational_pred(x) AND integer_pred(x)) AND
      (FORALL (x: real): rational_pred(x) AND integer_pred(x)))
     AND
     (FORALL (x1: [real, real]):
        rational_pred(f(x1)) AND integer_pred(f(x1)));
\end{pvsex}
A warning is generated when simple constant judgements are declared to be
of a function type.\footnote{Earlier versions of PVS simply interpreted
this form as a closure condition, but this is less flexible.}  In
addition, this judgement will not help with the declaration \texttt{n}
above; it can only be used in higher-order functions, for example:
\begin{pvsex}
  F: [[int, int -> int] -> bool]
  FF: FORMULA F(f)
\end{pvsex}

The arguments for a function judgement follow the syntax for function
declarations; so a curried function may be given multiple judgements:
\begin{pvsex}
  f(x, y: real)(z: real): real
  f_closed: JUDGEMENT f(x, y: nat)(z: int) HAS\_TYPE int
  f2_closed: JUDGEMENT f(x, y: int) HAS\_TYPE [real -> int]
\end{pvsex}

If a constant judgement declaration specifies a name, it must refer to a
unique constant and its type must be compatible with the type expression
following the \texttt{HAS\_TYPE} keyword.  If it is a number, then its
type must be compatible with the \texttt{number} type.

Constant judgements generally lead to TCCs.  If no TCC is generated, then
the judgement is not actually needed, and a warning to this effect is
produced.  Simple (non-functional) constant judgements generate TCCs
indicating that the constant belongs to the specified type.  Constant
function judgements generate TCCs that reflect closure conditions.

The judgement facility cannot be used to remove all redundant TCCs; the
variables used for arguments must be unique, and full expressions may not
be included.  Hence the following are not legal:
\begin{pvsex}
  x: VAR real
  x_times_x_is_nonneg: JUDGEMENT *(x, x) HAS\_TYPE nonneg_real
  c: real
  x_times_c_is_even: JUDGEMENT *(x, c) HAS\_TYPE (even?)
\end{pvsex}


\subsection{Subtype Judgements}
\index{subtype judgement}

The subtype judgement is used to fill in edges of the subtype graph that
otherwise are unknown to the typechecker.  For example, consider the
following declarations:
\begin{pvsex}
  nonzero_real: NONEMPTY_TYPE = \setb{}r: real | r /= 0\sete CONTAINING 1
  rational: NONEMPTY_TYPE FROM real
  nonneg_rat: NONEMPTY_TYPE = \setb{}r: rational | r >= 0\sete CONTAINING 0
  posrat: NONEMPTY_TYPE = \setb{}r: nonneg_rat | r > 0\sete  CONTAINING 1
  /: [real, nonzero_real -> real]
\end{pvsex}
For \texttt{r} of type \texttt{real} and \texttt{q} of type
\texttt{posrat}, the expression \texttt{r/q} leads to the TCC \texttt{q
/= 0}.  One solution, if \texttt{q} is a constant, is to use a constant
judgement as described above.  But if there are many constants involving
the type \texttt{posrat}, this requires a lot of judgement declarations,
and does not help at all for variables or compound expressions.  The
subtype judgement solves this by stating that \texttt{posrat} is a subtype
of \texttt{nzrat}.  Another subtype judgement states that \texttt{nzrat}
is a subtype of \texttt{nzreal}:
\begin{pvsex}
  JUDGEMENT posrat SUBTYPE_OF nzrat
  JUDGEMENT nzrat SUBTYPE_OF nzreal
\end{pvsex}
With these judgements, TCCs will not be generated for any denominator that
is of type \texttt{posrat}.  With the (prelude) judgement declarations
\begin{pvsex}
  nnrat_plus_posrat_is_posrat:   JUDGEMENT +(nnx, py) HAS_TYPE posrat
  posrat_times_posrat_is_posrat: JUDGEMENT *(px, py)  HAS_TYPE posrat
\end{pvsex}
not only are there no TCCs generated for \texttt{r/q}, but none are
generated for \texttt{r/(q + 2)}, \texttt{r/((q + 2) * q)}, etc.

Given a subtype judgement declaration of the form
\begin{pvsex}
  JUDGEMENT S SUBTYPE_OF T
\end{pvsex}
it is an error if \texttt{S} is already known to be a subtype of
\texttt{T}, or if they are not compatible.  Otherwise, \texttt{T} must be
of the form \texttt{\setb{}x:\ ST | p(x)\sete}, where \texttt{ST} is the least
compatible type of \texttt{S} and \texttt{T}, and a TCC will be generated
of the form \texttt{FORALL (x:S): p(x)}.  Remember that subtyping on
functions only works on range types, so the subtype judgement
\begin{pvsex}
  JUDGEMENT [nat -> nat] SUBTYPE_OF [int -> int]
\end{pvsex}
leads to the unprovable TCC
\begin{pvsex}
FORALL (x1:nat, y1:int): y1 >= 0 AND TRUE
\end{pvsex}

\subsection{Judgement Processing}

When a judgement declaration is typechecked, TCCs are generated as
explained above and the judgement is added to the current context for use
in typechecking expressions.  The typechecker typechecks expressions in
two passes; in the first pass it simply collects possible types for
subexpressions, and in the second pass it recursively tries to determine a
unique type based on the expected type, and generates TCCs accordingly;
this is where judgements are used.  If the expression is a constant (name
or number), then all non-functional judgements are collected for that
constant and used to generate a minimal TCC relative to the expected type.

If it is an application whose operator is a name, then functional
judgements of the corresponding arity are collected for the operator, and
those judgements for which the application arguments are all known to be
of the corresponding judgement argument types are extracted, and a minimal
TCC is generated from these.

In addition to inhibiting the generation of TCCs during typechecking,
judgements are also important to the prover; they are used explicitly in
the \texttt{typepred} command, and implicitly in \texttt{assert}, where
the judgement type information is provided to the ground decision
procedures.

Subtype judgements are used in determining when one type is a subtype of
another, which is tested frequently during typechecking and proving,
including in the test on argument types described above.
