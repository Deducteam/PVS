\chapter{The Lexical Structure}\label{lexical}

\pvs\ specifications are text files, each composed of a sequence of
lexical elements which in turn are made up of characters.  The lexical
elements of \pvs\ are the identifiers, reserved words, special symbols,
numbers, whitespace characters, and comments.

Identifiers\index{identifiers} are composed of letters, digits, and the characters
{\tt \_} or {\tt ?}; they must begin with a letter.
They may be arbitrarily long, constrained only by the limits imposed by
the underlying Common Lisp system.  Identifiers are case-sensitive; {\tt
FOO}, {\tt Foo}, and {\tt foo} are different identifiers.  PVS strings
contain any ASCII character:  to include a {\tt "} in the string,
use {\tt \char'134 "} and to include a {\tt \char'134} use {\tt \char'134\char'134}.

The reserved words\index{reserved words} are shown in
Figure~\ref{reserved-words}.  Unlike identifiers, they are not
case-sensitive.  In this document, reserved words are always displayed in
upper case.  Note that identifiers may have reserved words embedded in
them, thus {\tt ARRAYALL} is a valid identifier and will not be confused
with the two embedded reserved words.  The meaning of the reserved words
are given in the appropriate sections; they are collected here for
reference.

The special symbols\index{special symbols} are listed in
Figure~\ref{special-symbols}.  All of these symbols are separators; they
separate identifiers, numbers, and reserved words.

The whitespace characters are space, tab, newline, return, and newpage;
they are used to separate other lexical elements.  At least one whitespace
character must separate adjacent identifiers, numbers, and reserved words.

Comments\index{comments} may appear anywhere that a whitespace character
is allowed.  They consist of the `{\tt \%}'\index{\%@{\tt \%}} character
followed by any sequence of characters and terminated by a newline.

The \emph{definable} symbols are shown in table~\ref{definable-symbols}.
These keywords and symbols may be given declarations.  Some of them have
declarations given in the prelude.  Any of these may be (re)declared any
number of times, though this may lead to ambiguities.  Symbols that are
binary infix (\hyperlink{Binop}{\emph{Binop}}), for example \texttt{AND}
and \texttt{+}, may be declared with any number of arguments.  If they are
declared with two arguments then they may subsequently be used in prefix
or infix form.  Otherwise they may only be used in prefix form.
Similarly for unary operators.

The symbol pairs \lit{[|} and \lit{|]}, \lit{(|} and \lit{|)}, and
\lit{\{|} and \lit{|\}} are available as outfix operators.  They are
declared using \lit{[||]}, \lit{(||)}, and \lit{\{||\}}, respectively.
For example, with the declaration \texttt{[||]:\ [bool, int -> int]} the
outfix term \texttt{[| TRUE, 0 |]} is equivalent to the prefix form
\texttt{[||](TRUE, 0)}.
