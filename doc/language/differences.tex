\begin{description}

\item[Binding expressions (\texttt{LAMBDA}, \texttt{FORALL}, etc.)] -
binding expressions may no longer take a simple operator (\emph{opsym}).
Thus \texttt{LAMBDA <: 3 < 4} is not allowed.  This is because the new
grammar allows user-defined bindings, and the parser generator used in PVS
forces this restriction.  The workaround is simply to enclose the opsym in
parentheses: \texttt{LAMBDA (<): 3 < 4}.
