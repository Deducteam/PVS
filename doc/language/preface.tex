%\chapter{Preface}

This report presents a description of the \pvs\ specification language,
as implemented in Version 1.0 beta of the \pvs\ specification and
verification environment.  It is intended to provide a reference of all
of the features of the language, including the complete grammar, some
examples, and an informal semantics. This report is one of several
needed to effectively use \pvs.  Companion documents are devoted to the
use of the system~\cite{PVS:userguide}, the user of the
prover~\cite{PVS:prover}, a tutorial introduction~\cite{PVS:tutorial},
and a semantics~\cite{PVS:semantics}.

\memo{Give prerequisites to using \pvs.}

The \pvs\ system is the culmination of the effort of a large number of
people over many years, drawing heavily from the research and experience
gained from E{\sc
hdm}~\cite{EHDM:Userguide,EHDM:Language,EHDM:semantics,EHDM:supplement,EHDM:tutorial}.
The primary contributers to E{\sc hdm} in rough chronological order
were Michael Melliar-Smith, Richard Schwartz, Rob Shostak, Judith Crow,
Friedrich von Henke, Stan Jefferson, Rosanna Lee, John Rushby, Mark
Stickel, Natarajan Shankar, Sam Owre, David Cyrluk, Steven Phillips,
and Carl Witty.
%In addition to those named above, valuable contributions were made by
%Dorothy Denning, Brian Fromme, Allen van Gelder, Dwight Hare, Peter
%Ladkin, Sheralyn Listgarten, Jeff Miner, Paul Oppenheimer, Jeff
%Reninger, and Lorna Shinkle.
\pvs\ is primarily the work of John Rushby, Natarajan Shankar, Sam Owre,
Friedrich von Henke, David Cyrluk, and Carl Witty.

The present version of the \pvs\ Language Description was assembled by
Sam Owre, Natarajan Shankar, and John Rushby.
