As of PVS 3.0, building the system is somewhat different.  After a 
checkout from the CVS repository, do:

autoconf
sh configure --with-ics=/project/pvs/ics [--with-pvspath=/project/pvs/pvs3.0]
make

The configure takes care of the things that used to get performed 
by "make install".  The path to a version of ICS must be given, and 
the pvspath can optionally be specified if it's different from the 
result of "pwd".
