<h3>Abstract</h3>

We describe the formal specification and verification of an algorithm
for Interactive Consistency based on the Oral Messages algorithm for
Byzantine Agreement.  We compare our treatment with that of Bevier and
Young, who presented a formal specification and verification for a
very similar algorithm.  Unlike Bevier and Young, who observed that
``the invariant maintained in the recursive subcases of the algorithm
is significantly more complicated than is suggested by the published
proof'' and who found its formal verification ``a fairly difficult
exercise in mechanical theorem proving,'' our treatment is very close
to the previously published analysis of the algorithm, and our formal
specification and verification are straightforward.<p>

This example illustrates how delicate choices in the formulation of a
problem can have significant impact on the readability of its formal
specification and on the tractability of its formal verification.<p>
