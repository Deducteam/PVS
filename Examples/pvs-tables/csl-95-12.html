<h4>CSL Technical Report CSL-95-12</h4>
Note: this revised edition of the report differs significantly
from the draft issued in June 1995.

<p>A <a href=http://www.csl.sri.com/tacas97.html>shorter version</a> was published in
TACAS 97.


<h3>Abstract</h3>

We describe PVS's capabilities for representing tabular
specifications of the kind advocated by Parnas and others, and show
how PVS's Type Correctness Conditions (TCCs) are used to ensure
certain well-formedness properties.
<p>

We then show how these and other capabilities of PVS can be used to
represent the AND/OR tables of Leveson and the Decision Tables of
Sherry, and we demonstrate how PVS's TCCs can expose and help isolate
errors in the latter.
<p>

We extend this approach to represent the mode transition tables of
the Software Cost Reduction (SCR) method in an attractive manner.  We
show how PVS can check these tables for well-formedness, and how
PVS's model checking capabilities can be used to verify invariants
and reachability properties of SCR requirements specifications, and
inclusion relations between the behaviors of different
specifications.
<p>

These examples demonstrate how several capabilities of the PVS
language and verification system can be used in combination to
provide customized support for specific methodologies for documenting
and analyzing requirements.  Because they use only the standard
capabilities of PVS, users can adapt and extend these customizations
to suit their own needs.  Those developing dedicated tools for
individual methodologies may find these constructions in PVS helpful
for prototyping purposes, or as a useful adjunct to a dedicated tool
when the capabilities of a full theorem prover are required.
<p>

The examples also illustrate the power and utility of an integrated
general-purpose system such as PVS.  For example, there was no need
to adapt or extend the PVS model checker in order to make it work with
SCR specifications described using the PVS TABLE construct: the
model checker is applicable to any transition relation,
independently of the PVS language constructs used in its definition.
