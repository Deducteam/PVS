<h3>Abstract</h3>
PVS is a verification system that provides a specification language
integrated with support tools and a theorem-prover.  It has been used
at SRI and elsewhere to perform verifications of several significant
algorithms (primarily for fault-tolerance) and large hardware designs.
<p>
This tutorial introduces some of the more powerful strategies provided
by the PVS theorem prover.  It consists of two parts: the first
extends a previous tutorial by Ricky Butler
(<a href="http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/ftp/larc/PVS-tutorial/revised-pvs-tutorial.dvi">dvi</a>
or <a href="http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/ftp/larc/PVS-tutorial/revised-pvs-tutorial.ps">postscript</a>)
demonstrating how his proofs may be performed in a more automated
manner; the second uses the ``unwinding theorem'' from the
noninterference formulation of security to introduce theorem-proving
strategies for induction that cannot be demonstrated
in the framework of Ricky Butler's example.<p>

Using the more powerful strategies of PVS to automate easy proofs (and
the easy parts of hard proofs) frees users to concentrate on truly
difficult proofs.  Automation also makes proofs more robust to changes
in the specification, thereby facilitating active design exploration
and adaptation to changed requirements.<p>

This tutorial also shows how specifications and proofs may be better
presented using the LaTeX and PostScript generating facilities of
PVS.

<br> There isn't much documentation on Mizar;  in addition to the
papers at the link above,
<a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jrh/papers/mizar.html>
A Mizar Mode for HOL</a> by John Harrison is a useful
guide, and also of interest in its own right.
