  "Decision procedure for Weak Second-order monadic logic of 1 Successor (WS1S)
   based on the Mona package developed at BRICS (http://www.brics.dk/~mona).
   Expands definitions in the formulas specified by FNUMS, applies Boolean
   abstraction for formulas outside the scope of WS1S, and constructs an
   automata that recognizes the 'language' of interpretations of these formulas.

   The argument FNUMS restricts the focus of the strategy to the thereby specified sequent
   formulas. If EXAMPLES is true, a witness and a counterexample are being displayed if these
   formulas turn out to be satisfiable but not valid setting the flag AUTOMATON causes
   the strategy to display the constructed automaton, TRACES displays a trace version of
   the witness. For a description of the remaining flags DEFS, THEORIES, REWRITES, and
   EXCLUDE see e.g. (help install-rewrites).

   The supported fragment includes boolean expression, arithmetic on the
   natural numbers restricted to addition/subraction with/from a constant, and
   operations on finite sets over the naturals like union, intersection, set
   difference, addition and removal of a natural.  Predicates include arithmetic
   comparisons like <, <=, >, >=, equality, disequality, the subset relation,
   and membership in the form P(i). There is quantification over the booleans,
   the natural numbers, finite sets of naturals, and predicate subtypes of the
   aforementioned types built from formulas in the set just being described.
   Furthermore, this strategy tries to apply boolean abstraction for non-WS1S formulas,
   and natural numbers, and finite sets of natural numbers may also be described
   using the 'the' operator; e.g. ripple-carry addition may be defined as:
     +(P, Q: finite_set[nat]): finite_set[nat] = 
       the({R: finite_set[nat] | 
         EXISTS (C: finite_set[nat]): NOT(C(0)) AND
           FORALL (t: nat):
             (C(t + 1) = ((P(t) AND Q(t)) OR (P(t) AND C(t)) OR (Q(t) AND C(t)))) AND
                 (R(t) = P(t) = Q(t) = C(t))});"
