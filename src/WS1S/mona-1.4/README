Please read the file 'COPYING' before you compile MONA.

To compile MONA you need the GNU C/C++ compiler and the tools 'bison',
'flex', 'gmake', and 'ar'. Running 'gmake' in the directory where this
file is residing will (hopefully) generate the file 'mona'.  (You
might need to edit the 'config' file.)  Running 'mona' with no
arguments will show the command-line usage.

The 'MONA Version 1.3 User Manual' is available from the MONA
homepage. It is currently being updated to Version 1.4.

Information about the Graphviz tool for visualization of DFAs 
can be found at http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/.

A simple Emacs MONA mode is available in this package. 
See 'mona-mode.el' for further information.

The directory 'Lib' contains libraries for using the external
automaton format and some example applications.
The directory 'Examples' contains the MONA programs shown in the
manual and some example applications of the BDD, DFA and GTA packages
using the internal representation.

If you have any problems or questions about the source code,
