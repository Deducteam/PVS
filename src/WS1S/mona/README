Welcome to MONA Version 1.3!

Please read the file 'COPYRIGHT' before you compile MONA.

To compile MONA you need the GNU C/C++ compiler and the GNU tools 
'bison', 'flex' and 'gmake'. Running 'gmake' in the directory where 
this file is residing will (hopefully) generate the file 'mona'. 
Running 'mona' with no arguments will show the usage.

The 'MONA Version 1.3 User Manual' is available from the MONA homepage.

Information about the Graphviz tool for visualization of DFAs 
can be found at http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/.

A simple Emacs MONA mode is available in this package. 
See 'mona-mode.el' for further information.

The directory 'Lib' contains libraries for using the external automaton 
format and some example applications.
The directory 'Examples' contains the MONA programs shown in the manual
and some example applications of the BDD, DFA and GTA packages using 
the internal representation.

If you have any problems or questions about the source code, 
please send email to
