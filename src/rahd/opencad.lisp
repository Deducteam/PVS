;;; A decision method for testing the emptiness of open semialgebraic sets,
;;;  each defined as the intersection of finitely many open sets, each defined
;;;  as the set of satisfying real vectors of a polynomial strict inequality.
;;;
;;; This is done via a connection to the cylindrical algebraic decomposition
;;;  package QEPCAD-B, by quantifying every variable in an open semialgebraic
;;;  definition with the EXISTS-INFINITELY-MANY quantifier ((F x) in QEPCAD-B
;;;  notation).

;;; A feasible decision method for the existential theory of real closed fields.

;;; Note: We have now added a ``generic'' mode for interfacing with QEPCAD.
;;;  This mode is for semialgebraic sets that are not a priori known to be
;;;  open.  In this case, we cannot use the EX-INF-MANY relaxation, and just
;;;  do straight-forward CAD.
;;;

;;;
;;; Given an open conjunction, produce an EX-INF relaxation of the problem
;;; as a string in QEPCAD-B notation.
;;;
;;; If generic is T, then we do generic CAD instead of EX-INF relaxation.
