;;; The context has a judgements slot, which consists of a judgements
;;; instance, which in turn has slots:
;;;   judgement-types-hash: maps expressions to judgement types
;;;   number-judgements-hash:
;;;     eql hashtable on numbers; returns a list of judgements
;;;   name-judgements-hash:
;;;     eq hashtable on declarations; returns a name-judgements instance
;;;     with slots:
;;;       minimal-judgements: a list of fully-instantiated judgements
;;;       generic-judgements: an assoc list of theory instances to judgements
;;;   application-judgements-hash:
;;;     eq hashtable on declarations; returns a application-judgements instance
;;;     with slots:
;;;       argtype-hash: maps argument type lists to judgement types
;;;       judgements-graph: a graph of the fully-instantiated judgements
;;;       generic-judgements: an assoc list of theory instances to judgements

;;; There are three places where judgement declarations are added to the
;;; context:
;;;   1. when typechecking a judgement declaration: add-judgement-decl
;;;   2. when typechecking a new theory: copy-judgements
;;;   3. when importing a theory that has judgements: merge-judgements
;;; When the prover gets a new context, the judgements do not need to be
;;; copied.

;;; There are two times that judgements are looked up in the context:
;;;   1. during set-type, and
;;;   2. when collecting typepred/record-constraints.
;;; The judgements function is used for these.

;;; set-type.lisp uses the following:
;;;   find-best-type: judgement-types
;;; assert.lisp:
;;;   assert-if-inside-sign: judgement-types
;;;   collect-type-constraints-step: judgement-types
;;;   assert-if (application): judgement-types
;;; proofrules.lisp:
;;;   collect-typepreds: judgement-types

;;; Functions for the application-judgement graph.  The
;;; application-judgements-hash of the judgements of a context maps
;;; operator declarations to application-judgements instances, and the
;;; judgements-graph of one of these instances is a bottom node, with a
;;; null judgement-decl.  All judgement declarations for a given operator
;;; may be found in the transitive closure of the parents of this node.

;;; To add a node, we need to find all nodes immediately below the given
;;; one, add the new node to the parents of each of those nodes, 
;;; and add any parents of those nodes that should be above the new node
;;; to the parents of the new node, removing them from the found nodes.
